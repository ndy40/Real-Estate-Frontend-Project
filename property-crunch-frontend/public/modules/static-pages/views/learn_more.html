                    Find good investment property
                </accordion-heading>
                <p>Find properties in desirable areas with good commute links, an area that is popular with families or has a sizeable university. Another indicator is the regeneration in the area, as this tend to attract better off population. i.e people that can afford higher property prices and rents.</p>
                <p>Looking at properties that need improvement is a good way to boost the value of your investment. Tired properties or outdated properties can be negotiated hard on to get a better price and then renovated to add value. However, remember to ensure that the purchase price is low enough to cover refurbishment and some profit, and allow for the inevitable over-run on costs.</p>

                <p>Focus on your local economy. Do not be distracted by what’s happening everywhere else but focus more on the activities in the area you plan to invest in. i.e Are prices rising or falling?</p>
                <p>Before making an offer on a property, be aware of what similar properties are valued at or renting for. Run some numbers on each property you are interested in to gauge the potential return on investment. Do not waste time viewing a property if the numbers do not stack up. i.e the property is overvalued or weak rental in the area. </p>

                <p>Although the conventional wisdom is “cheaper is better” since finding an undervalued properties means that an investor might be making a profit from day 1, we believe an investor should wear many thinking hats. i.e There are opportunities to buy properties that can be extended or converted to extend their value. These types of properties might not necessarily be undervalued but the process of extending the property or converting can increase the valuation of the property. For example, converting a 2 bedroom house into a 3 bed. </p>
                <p>When making an offer on a properties, consider all options and find a price point that doesn’t break the bank. Remember that you are not planning to live there (this is not your dream home) so leave all emotions at the door. Focus on the numbers.</p>

                    Appoint a letting Agent Vs Self Managing 
                </accordion-heading>
                <p>Some landlords choose to employ letting agents to market and manage their buy to let properties, while others choose to handle the process themselves. There is no right or wrong answer to this, it all depends on the time you can afford to dedicate to the process. </p>
                <p>Property management can be time consuming, with a lot of checks to go through before you can let out your property. However, letting agents have wealth of experience that you can benefit from; such as tenant checks and managing the wear & tear of the property.</p>
                <p>Emphasis should be placed on tenant checks as a bad tenant can cost tens of thousands of damage to property. If a tenant doesn’t pay rent, there is added pressure to cover mortgage payments. </p>
                <p>If you decide to go with a letting agent, only choose an agent who is a member of <a href="http://www.nalscheme.co.uk/">NALS</a> and/or <a href="http://www.arla.co.uk/">ARLA</a>.</p>

They will be able to provide an estimate on the cost of renovating or bringing the property up to standard. This cost needs to be factored in the purchase price. In some cases, the seller will be open to negotiating the asking price to make room for the cost of renovation. Feel free to let the seller know your intentions on the work to be carried out on the property. </p>
